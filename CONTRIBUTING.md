# Contributing
We are always happy to see people interested in our work. Therefore if you have found a missing feature or a bug, you can either open a pull request, or an issue. As we have a Gitter channel, you can also [join us](https://gitter.im/Sw24Softwares/StarkeVerben?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)

## Coding rule
We do not have a specific coding rule, thus you can add your style to the submitted code.

## Issue
An issue is a good start to contribute. If you have an idea for an extra feature, detail it as far as you can. Do not forget to add images that could help us seeing what you think.

## Pull Request
A pull request is for us easier than an issue, as we do not have to code the feature ourself. Nonetheless do not forget to test you code before submitting it, or specify it in the comments.

## Translation
As it is an application for an educational purpose, we want to reach a large number of people. Thus if you speak a non-supported language, your help is welcome. There is many way for you to participate :
- Translating the GUI, by adding a directory in app/src/main/res/. It should be named values-[codename], where codename is the two letter caracterising a language (see ISO 639-1 [here](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php))
- Translating the verbs, by adding a file in app/src/main/assets/. It should be named [language].txt where language is the language in english and beginning with an uppercase letter.
